TODO
--------
Create a level class that handles the background transitions, the layout of the enemies and when the boss initiates
Tweak the Enemy class so their positions are randomized when initiated (to stop it being too boring)
Figure out how to make waves of enemies that move in shapes (initiate the positions with a for loop, probably, think of Mario from CS50)
Create player to enemy collision detection
Add sprites
